# Quality Tools for BlueJ (QT4BJ) - Build Information

## Required Java version(s)
The JDK version should match the requirements of the targeted version of BlueJ. See the [main BlueJ website](https://www.bluej.org/) or download previous [BlueJ versions](https://www.bluej.org/versions.html) which include the necessary JDK(s).

## Gradle wrapper usage
A Gradle wrapper class is supplied with this project. It is recommended to execute Gradle commands using the project wrapper (see [Gradle wrapper documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html). Simply run all build-related commands using the `gradlew` prefix to execute the wrapper class and ensure the correct build settings are used (i.e. use `gradlew build` instead of `gradle build`).
